To choose the time you have to press on the minutes box (aka this : 00:...), then delete the zeros and type the number of the minutes that you want.
And to start it you have to press the start button, if you want to pause you have to press the pause button, and if you want to reset the timer you have to press the reset button!

left above you can see two buttons, this (!) is the about page, i talked about myself on it, and the other button is settings button, it lets you choose if you want music to be played automatically after you finish the timer or not, you can enable or disable it.


I made this project because most of my friends and me love to study with pomodoro timers, so i decided to make one and surprise them! and because i think it may be helpful for most of us as high schoolers!
It called lolow, cause i have a cat called "lolo" so i decided to make the website with her name (or close to it) because the main character in the website is a cat >~<

I made the project using HTML for the elements, CSS to design and Javascript for functionalities.

While designing this website i struggled because it was my first time to make one alone without a team or something , and i wasn't really good in web development, but i tried to learn while designing and i decided to not learn in a traditional way like watching youtube vids, i decided to try everything alone and when i struggle with something i will search until i find a solution, and thats how i designed this whole website, and thats why it took 16 hours!!
The hardest thing i faced it to arrange the elements,and to hide the overflow >^< but i will keep learning so i can enhance it!

At the end, my front-end skills improved so much! and finally now i am able to make websites alone :)
